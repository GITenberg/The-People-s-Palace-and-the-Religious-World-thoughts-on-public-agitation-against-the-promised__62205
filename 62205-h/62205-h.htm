3</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Disagreement</span> with the object and
dislike of the tone of the incipient agitation for preventing the
concession of a Royal Charter to the Crystal Palace Company,
except upon the condition of its gates being closed on
Sunday&mdash;a desire to vindicate the consistency of many
religious people, whose silence might be construed into sympathy
with the movement&mdash;and the wish to offer a few thoughts on
the impolicy, in a religious point of view, of such attacks on
the pleasures of the poor:&mdash;are, in brief, the motives which
have determined the printing of the following pages.&nbsp; The
Writer believes the ground traversed is firm and solid, though he
is unable to beguile the journey with those flowers of rhetoric
and gleams of warm fancy with which more gifted writers can
brighten their course.&nbsp; Though inexperience in book-making
and pamphleteering is no excuse for unsound conclusions, he hopes
it may avail to disarm the severity of criticism.&nbsp; Convinced
that for the advantage of true religion, as well as its
professors, the ideas he has broached require to be freely,
closely, and sincerely discussed, he ventures to claim for them
candid and unprejudiced consideration.&nbsp; He hopes it is
superfluous to state that he has no pecuniary interest in, nor
connexion with, the project in question.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>THE
PEOPLE&rsquo;S PALACE,<br />
<i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Shall</span> the new Crystal Palace be
open on Sunday?&nbsp; This question is exciting a good deal of
attention&mdash;especially in the religious world, and is likely
to attract more, ere finally set at rest.&nbsp; It is a question
of magnitude, and possibly of political importance.&nbsp; It
becomes, therefore, the duty of all who feel interested in its
solution, to ascertain clearly the facts upon which it is based,
the principles with which it is bound up, and the consequences
which will flow from its decision.&nbsp; The occasion seems to
have been seized upon by what may be called the Sabbatarian
party, to make a determined stand on behalf of the principle for
which they have often fought and been vanquished&mdash;the right
of the religious world to impose their notions of Sabbath
observance upon the community at large.&nbsp; The particular
point at issue may be readily decided by any unbiassed mind, on
examination of the actual facts.&nbsp; But the Sabbatarians
refuse to be bound down to the case as it stands.&nbsp; They
exaggerate and pervert the facts; and, under cover of the smoke
and excitement thus created, advance to a general assault upon
what they term &ldquo;Sabbath desecration.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
design of the next few pages is rather to point out the impolicy,
danger, and hopelessness of any public movement to prevent the
opening of this place of recreation on the Sunday, than to
advocate or defend that step.</p>
<p>Although the facts of the case are conveniently lost sight of
by the agitators in question, they are really so important to a
right understanding of its merits as to admit of
re-statement.&nbsp; It appears, then, that the New Crystal Palace
at Sydenham is in the hands of a joint-stock company, and is to
be conducted on the same commercial principles as all
speculations of a like character.&nbsp; Their object is <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>familiar to
every newspaper reader.&nbsp; In brief, they propose to provide
for the people recreation and instruction of a kind not now
within their reach.&nbsp; If the programme be faithfully carried
out, the project will unquestionably tend to improve the health,
enlarge the knowledge, and refine the taste of the public.&nbsp;
The Company have applied for a Royal Charter of Incorporation,
the effect of which, as is well known, is to confine the
liability of individual shareholders to the amount of their
shares.&nbsp; In making their application to Lord Derby, the
Directors, we are told by the <i>Times</i>, communicated to his
Lordship the terms upon which they proposed to open the building
and grounds on Sunday.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were of opinion that
until after one o&rsquo;clock no trains should run from London,
and the Crystal Palace itself should be strictly closed.&nbsp;
After that hour they proposed to throw open the park and the
winter-garden, but not to exhibit those departments of the
building which will partake exclusively of a manufacturing and
commercial character, the intention being to devote a certain
portion of the space to specimens of manufacture, &amp;c., which
the public will be invited, upon certain conditions, to
display.&nbsp; In the third place, the Directors undertook that
on Sunday no spirituous liquors should be sold in their
grounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; After an interview with the Directors, Lord
Derby acquiesced in the stipulations proffered by the Crystal
Palace Company, suggested a few trifling variations, and promised
to grant the required Charter.</p>
<p>The announcement of this decision or promise&mdash;for it can
scarcely be regarded as a <i>fait accompli</i>&mdash;has excited
not a little alarm amongst a section of the religious
world.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s Day Society have taken up the
matter very warmly&mdash;publishing pamphlets and holding public
meetings in condemnation of the arrangement.&nbsp; The
Evangelical Alliance, a wide-spread organization, at its recent
Conference in Dublin, adopted a strongly-worded resolution and
memorial to the Prime Minister to the same effect.&nbsp; These
acts of organized bodies have been vigorously followed up by
journals representing respectively the Evangelical clergy of the
Establishment, Wesleyans, Free Churchmen, and a portion of the
Dissenting community; who call upon their readers, in every
capacity, and by every means, to resist the proposed
&ldquo;wholesale violation of the Lord&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; The strength of this
disapprobation <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>and alarm may be gathered from one or two
quotations.&nbsp; A widely-circulated religious magazine
denounces the proposal as &ldquo;sinful,&rdquo; and calculated to
&ldquo;lead to sin on an extensive and alarming scale,&rdquo; and
calls &ldquo;upon all religious and moral men, throughout the
United Kingdom, to lift up their voices like a trumpet, and to
cause them to be heard on this great and vital
question.&rdquo;&nbsp; A very influential newspaper in the North
predicts that &ldquo;the measure will have a most fatal operation
on the religious interests of the country,&rdquo; and urges a
general expression of public opinion &ldquo;to prevent the
Minister from persevering in his intention to grant a Charter
containing permission to open the Crystal Palace on
Sunday.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Clapham clergyman, in a pamphlet very
loosely put together, <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a> says, &ldquo;The
projected <i>aggression of pleasure</i> in 1853, is to me a
greater object of dread than the <i>aggression of Popery</i> in
1850, because it falls in with the taste of the vast majority of
mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; A metropolitan Dissenting journal speaks of
the question as one involving a principle &ldquo;that would
speedily extend itself to other institutions,&rdquo; and
expresses its belief that the recognition by the State that the
Sabbath ends at one o&rsquo;clock, would be &ldquo;a far deeper
stab to public morality, and afford a greater triumph to Popery
and Infidelity, than any act of the British Government since the
days of James II.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ministers of religion, of every
denomination, are therefore called upon to protest against the
threatened evil, and Sunday-school teachers to petition against a
measure aiming a deadly blow at those institutions.&nbsp; Another
London paper is even more emphatic, not to say intemperate, upon
the subject, describing &ldquo;this new guild of Sunday traders
as craving, through the sign-manual of the Sovereign, license to
open a gorgeous temple of rampant pleasure, and to filch, by
Royal authority, both coin and conscience from every unit of the
countless myriads, which from Sunday to Sunday, they know, will
throng to this haunt of unzoned enjoyment, and this under the
wicked plea of sympathy for the poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are but
specimens of the style of writing adopted by the self-elected
defenders of &ldquo;Sabbath observance,&rdquo; in order to excite
their readers to the proper pitch of apprehension.&nbsp; But
<i>ex pede Herculem</i>.&nbsp; They will suffice to indicate the
real or affected panic which seems to have seized the leading <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>organs of the
religious world, at the proposed boon to the Crystal Palace
Company&mdash;an alarm, be it observed, which may be communicated
to thousands of minds, and result in a virulent, perhaps a
formidable movement.&nbsp; Before matters have assumed this
shape, it in worth while to inquire what occasion there is for
all this outcry, and whether Christian men are either right,
honest, or wise, in originating a wide-spread agitation to
prevent the concession of the promised Charter.</p>
<p>The end sought by the objectors is twofold&mdash;first, the
prevention of the threatened act of &ldquo;Sabbath
desecration&rdquo; by Royal authority; and second, the entire
closing of the Palace on Sunday.&nbsp; To produce the greater
effect upon the public, the two questions are ingeniously, but
unscrupulously, mixed up, and furnish a wide margin for that kind
of indignant declamation on encroaching upon &ldquo;the poor
man&rsquo;s day of rest,&rdquo; opening the floodgates of vice
and irreligion, &amp;c., &amp;c., which is likely to tell on the
unreflecting.&nbsp; For purposes of dispassionate inquiry, the
questions are better separated.</p>
<p>It appears, then, that the Sabbatarian party are greatly
alarmed at the contemplated sanction by the Crown of the opening
of this great theatre of secular enjoyment on Sunday.&nbsp; It
is, they say, a public recognition by the State of the Sabbath as
a secular institution&mdash;official encouragement to
Sabbath-breaking.&nbsp; It may be objected, <i>in limine</i>,
that the facts of the case do not bear out their assertion in the
form presented.&nbsp; When the new Company went to Government,
they were <i>already</i> in possession of the right to open their
grounds on Sunday.&nbsp; The Crystal Palace is private property;
and if the law permits Cremorne and Rosherville Gardens to be
open on that day, what is to prevent the Sydenham Company from
using the same privilege?&nbsp; They, like other joint-stock
companies, could exist and conduct the speculation without the
advantages of a Royal Charter.&nbsp; It is, then, clearly a
mistake to suppose that they request Government to sanction the
exercise of that right.&nbsp; They do no such thing.&nbsp; In
asking for the advantages of a Charter, they <i>volunteer</i>
certain concessions to the feelings of the religious world.&nbsp;
If Lord Derby had declared himself not satisfied with the
conditions, they might have turned round and said: &ldquo;We
will, then, do without the privilege, and pursue our own course
unshackled by any restrictions beyond what the law
imposes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whichever way, therefore, the question is
settled, it cannot be fairly alleged that the State makes itself
a party to &ldquo;Sabbath desecration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may further be urged, that Government have no right to
refuse, <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>on
religious grounds, a privilege which it happens to be at their
discretion to confer.&nbsp; To upholders of the principle of a
State religion this argument will, of course, not avail.&nbsp;
They will maintain that the Queen is the Head of the Church,
which, by a legal fiction, includes the nation; and that,
therefore, the exercise of her influence in this matter is
perfectly legitimate.&nbsp; But where is the educated man who, in
the present day, advocates the <i>theory</i> of a church
establishment in all its entirety&mdash;that is, who would insist
upon the duty of the State to maintain &ldquo;the truth,&rdquo;
or, in other words, to exclude all Dissenters and Catholics from
Parliament, and repeal the Toleration Act?&nbsp; The present
system of toleration is confessedly a half-way house to full
religious freedom.&nbsp; So long as Dissent in any shape is
recognised by the Government, that Government&mdash;which, for
civil purposes, represents the whole community, and is, moreover,
virtually chosen and controlled by a power composed of diverse
religious elements&mdash;has no right to make itself the partisan
of any religious opinions.&nbsp; It has long given up the
principle in practical legislation, and the nation has ratified
the decision.&nbsp; It is really surprising that any Dissenters,
the fundamental principle of whose nonconformity is the
repudiation of State interference in religious matters, can, by
any sophistry, reconcile their minds to such a violation of it as
is involved in the demand made upon Government to become the
organ of particular religious views on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but,&rdquo; these Sabbatarians will, doubtless,
reply, &ldquo;we only call upon the Crown to preserve the Sabbath
as a civil institution&mdash;a day of rest from toil&mdash;a
barrier to the encroachments of &lsquo;money-getting&rsquo;
companies and capitalists.&rdquo;&nbsp; This style of argument is
very much like begging the question.&nbsp; It is simply a claim
that the State should accept <i>their</i> definition of what
constitutes &ldquo;a day of rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not an
enormous fallacy for religious men to seek to impose upon
Government their interpretation of the Sabbath,&mdash;which,
moreover, it cannot be denied, is at variance with that of the
bulk of the population,&mdash;and require that on
&ldquo;civil&rdquo; grounds it shall have the force of law upon
the nation?&nbsp; Cessation from labour, and the observance of
certain religious duties, are by no means one and the same
thing.&nbsp; The former may be perfectly consistent with an
excursion into the country, or recreation amid the woodland
scenery of Sydenham&mdash;which is the precise thing the
religious agitators, repudiate, and are trying to prevent.&nbsp;
The argument has force only when applied to the case of the
servants of the new company, who will be required to perform
certain work on the Sabbath; <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>but even to it is exceptional; for
there <i>are</i> cases in which even the most rigid Sabbatarians
would admit of deviations from its conclusions.</p>
<p>But, putting aside the principle involved;&mdash;on the ground
of expediency there are reasons why Government should not refuse
the promised Charter on the plea advanced.&nbsp; They would not
be acting consistently.&nbsp; Much stress is laid upon the
presumption that the granting of this Charter&mdash;or, as the
Sabbatarians say, the Royal sanction to an act of &ldquo;Sabbath
desecration&rdquo;&mdash;will be a precedent for the opening on
Sunday of every other place of amusement or recreation, in the
metropolis and kingdom.&nbsp; A precedent forsooth!&nbsp; Has not
the metropolis and every large town its tea-gardens, and places
of popular resort?&nbsp; The supply of this species of Sunday
enjoyment already pretty nearly equals the demand.&nbsp; The only
difference between them and the new claimant of popular favour
is, that the latter proposes to furnish a higher style of
recreation; and having many independent recommendations, asks
Government for the concession of a privilege granted to other
parties without regard to religious considerations.&nbsp; Would
Lord Derby be dealing out &ldquo;even-handed justice&rdquo; to
higgle with this new Company because it had a boon to ask, for a
concession to religious prejudice which was not required in other
cases?&nbsp; But, still further, with what decency could he
require the Crystal Palace Company to close their grounds on the
Sabbath, when the Hampton Court grounds are open to the public by
the express authority of the Government and Legislature?&nbsp;
The precedent, at which so much alarm has been expressed,
<i>has</i> for some years past been established.&nbsp; If, as one
of the agitating organs phrases it, the granting of the proposed
Charter would transfer the &ldquo;sin&rdquo; of Sabbath
desecration from individuals to the nation, we have been for some
time under the threatened curse.</p>
<p>There is no escape, therefore, from the conclusion, that if
the Crystal Palace grounds are to be closed on Sunday&mdash;the
present law being confessedly inadequate for that
purpose&mdash;it must be by a new act of legislation, not of
specific, but of general application&mdash;an act which will
include Hampton Court as well as Sydenham, and Rosherville as
well as Hampton Court&mdash;which will have the effect of
shutting up every place of popular recreation on Sunday.&nbsp;
Are the objectors to the Crystal Palace Charter prepared for such
a wholesale crusade against the recreations of the people?&nbsp;
Have they contemplated such an alternative?&nbsp; Probably
not&mdash;that is, so far as the rank and file of the new
agitation are concerned.&nbsp; As respects the leaders,
experience is the <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>best test; and from the avowed desire of the
Lord&rsquo;s Day Society, the Agnewites and the Plumptres, to
enforce by law the &ldquo;bitter observance of the Sabbath&rdquo;
upon the nation, it may be easily imagined that they have
anticipated such a crisis, and rather chuckle at the dilemma in
which many timid friends of religious
freedom&mdash;panic-stricken at the prospect of increased
&ldquo;Sabbath desecration&rdquo;&mdash;would thereby be
placed.&nbsp; Let the latter take warning in time.&nbsp; It is
only by a sweeping measure of legislation which would raise the
working classes up in arms against the religious world, that the
new Crystal Palace, or rather its grounds, can be closed on
Sunday.</p>
<p>If there be any truth in the foregoing arguments, the reckless
denunciations we have referred to seem very much beside the
mark.&nbsp; One might have been better pleased, if the tastes and
tendencies of the great bulk of the people were such that the
Sydenham Palace were no attraction to them on the
Sabbath&mdash;their leisure such as that they did not stand in
peremptory need of such relaxation.&nbsp; The more highly men
value communion with God, the more gladly will they cherish the
opportunities of cultivating the spiritual faculty on the day of
rest from secular employment.&nbsp; But it is only as the
privilege is valued that it is useful.&nbsp; The pleasure and the
profit go together.&nbsp; If there be not the spirit of devotion,
will the form of it suffice?&nbsp; Does not the very attempt to
impose the one where the other is wanting, indicate a
misconception of the true spirit of religion?&nbsp; The fuss made
by the religious organs about this proposed Charter is wholly
inexplicable on any rational grounds consistent with the
intelligence and truthfulness of those concerned.&nbsp; To speak
of it as fraught with injury to morality and religion is simply a
perversion of language&mdash;unsupported by evidence or
probabilities.&nbsp; For, observe&mdash;we are not, or only to a
small extent, dealing with a population who now
&ldquo;keep&rdquo; the Sabbath according to the notions of the
religious world, but with people who, if they do not spend the
Sunday at Sydenham, will, almost without exception, spend it in a
worse manner elsewhere.&nbsp; According to <i>their</i>
acceptation of a well-spent Sabbath, it is but a choice of
ills.&nbsp; Where, then, is the alarming evil?&nbsp; Is it, that
a saunter through the Crystal Palace grounds, reached by a
railway, is so much more irreligious than a stroll in the Parks,
reached by an omnibus?&nbsp; Does a change of scenery transform
the character of the deed?&nbsp; Do a man&rsquo;s nature and
tendencies become metamorphosed by exchanging, for a few hours,
his squalid abode for a public-house, a gin-palace, a steamboat,
a tea-garden, or a Crystal Palace?&nbsp; Is there something so
deleterious in a Sunday glance <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>at the beautiful prospects of
Anerley, that the country must be convulsed to prevent it? <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>It becomes Christian men to look this matter fairly in the
face, and not be deluded by cant and prejudice.&nbsp; Let them
manfully examine facts and probabilities, before they commit
themselves to unreasoning clamour.&nbsp; Neither the cause of
religion nor of truth will gain by allowing common sense to be
overborne by invective and exaggeration.&nbsp; The Sabbatarians
themselves will admit that the people who are likely to crown the
heights of Norwood are <i>not</i> those who would otherwise
frequent a place of worship; but, for the most part, overworked
artisans and labourers, with their families, who systematically
spend the Sabbath at the tea-garden or ale-house&mdash;who, if
they were not at Sydenham would perhaps be at
Gravesend&mdash;who, if they could not enjoy the beauties of
Sydenham, and restore their wasted energies amidst its
health-inspiring breezes, would probably kill the time by the
indulgence of depraved appetites in a poisoned atmosphere.&nbsp;
The recreations of Sydenham are as elevating, refining, and
harmless, as at any other place of Sunday resort&mdash;probably
more so.&nbsp; At the same time, they are more attractive.&nbsp;
Is it, then, so very irrational to suppose that, under the
circumstances of the case, the change will be a gain?&nbsp;
Surely it is not Quixotic, though opposed to the Sabbatarian
view, to conclude, that the facilities offered to the working
classes by means of steam for recruiting their strength and
improving their tastes by country excursions, and, in particular,
the superior attractions and judicious regulations of the new
Crystal Palace Company, are, on the whole, calculated to promote
the health, temperance, and morality of the people.</p>
<p>It is not assuming too much to conclude that the
&ldquo;attractions&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; of
Sydenham will be superior to those which obtain elsewhere, A
visit to the tea-gardens of Chelsea or Camberwell on a Sunday
afternoon or evening&mdash;accessible to all who purchase a
ticket of &ldquo;refreshment&rdquo;&mdash;will satisfy any
unprejudiced person on this head.&nbsp; The scenes he will there
witness can scarcely fail to convince him that the cause of
morality will gain from the transference of a portion of the
crowds there assembled to the Norwood grounds and their stricter
surveillance.&nbsp; Other things being equal, ought not the
religions world to <i>prefer</i> that the working classes of
London should enjoy the fresh <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>air of the tea-garden to the
drunkenness of the gin-palace&mdash;the temperance associated
with the sylvan landscape of Sydenham, to the license of
Cremorne?</p>
<p>No doubt there is another side to the picture.&nbsp; The event
so much deprecated will unquestionably tend to induce many people
to &ldquo;break the Sabbath&rdquo; who would not otherwise do
so.&nbsp; This will especially be the case with the young, who
will, to some extent, desert our Sunday-schools, as well as
places of worship.&nbsp; But the anticipation of harm from this
cause may be exaggerated.&nbsp; The attractions held out by the
Crystal Palace <i>do</i> exist elsewhere, with others of a more
baneful character, and you cannot suppress them but by a general
act of legislation.&nbsp; If the number of pleasure-takers is
increased, the influence for evil is diminished.&nbsp; The
argument, too, is essentially vicious; for if its &ldquo;superior
attractions&rdquo; is a reason for closing the Crystal Palace on
Sunday, fine weather is to be deprecated on the same ground, and
rain and fogs courted as the allies of church and school!</p>
<p>But the Crystal Palace Charter is menaced because it will rob
the poor of their day of rest!&nbsp; If the poor were
<i>obliged</i> to visit Sydenham on Sunday, there would be some
force in the plea.&nbsp; But it is notoriously otherwise.&nbsp;
Are not the hundreds and thousands who every Sunday crowd the
outward-bound railway-carriage, steamboat, and omnibus, following
their own inclination as much as the aristocracy who take their
afternoon airing in Hyde Park, or the thousands who frequent
their places of worship?&nbsp; What right, then, have the latter
to dictate to the former how they shall spend the day of
rest&mdash;or, unbidden, to constitute themselves the champions
of the &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s day?&rdquo;&nbsp; May not the
journals who hold such language be fairly called upon to produce
their authority?&nbsp; If the working-classes object to the
opening of the Crystal Palace, or to railway and steamboat
travelling, on Sunday, they will refrain from using them; but so
long as it is otherwise, nay, the reverse, religious men only
injure the Christianity they profess, and assume the garb of
hypocrites and intolerants, by pretending that the poor are
thereby wronged, and calling upon the Crown to interfere for
their protection.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Briefly to recapitulate the foregoing facts and
arguments:&mdash;The Crystal Palace Company is a private
speculation, not a public institution.&nbsp; They propose to open
<i>only</i> their grounds and winter-garden on Sunday, and that
but for half the day.&nbsp; This place of recreation, therefore,
stands on much the same footing as Richmond or any other <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>public
park&mdash;being accessible to the masses by no other means than
a conveyance&mdash;differing only in providing refreshment
(exclusive of spirituous liquors) to its frequenters.&nbsp; It is
untrue to assert that a Royal Charter will enable the Company to
open their grounds&mdash;for the right exists independent of the
Charter.&nbsp; Government, therefore, cannot be said to sanction
&ldquo;the desecration of the Sabbath&rdquo;&mdash;being unable
to prevent it.&nbsp; The State has no right to refuse a privilege
on religious grounds, seeing that it is a purely civil
institution, and bound to secure entire liberty of conscience;
which is inconsistent with partiality to the views of any
sect.&nbsp; To spend the Sabbath as a day of recreation does not
clash with its definition as &ldquo;a civil
institution.&rdquo;&nbsp; In exacting the shutting-up of the
Sydenham grounds, Government would be acting inequitably, for
other and worse pleasure-gardens are open on
Sunday&mdash;inconsistently, for the grounds of Hampton Court
Palace, which are national property, have been for some years
accessible to the people with their express sanction.&nbsp; It
would not, therefore, be a precedent for &ldquo;the desecration
of the Sabbath.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the Crystal Palace is closed on
that day by authority, all other places of recreation must be
closed also&mdash;for you cannot have partial legislation on the
subject.&nbsp; Such a general measure would be highly unjust and
injurious, besides being impracticable.&nbsp; The much-deprecated
event would not be likely to increase the irreligion or
immorality of the people; for, although some few might be led to
desert places of worship and neglect Sabbath privileges, by the
superior attractions of the Sydenham Palace, many more would
substitute its pleasures for those of a less elevating character,
offered without restriction elsewhere; while the bulk of those
who frequented it would not, in all probability, if it were
entirely closed, &ldquo;keep the Sabbath&rdquo; in the sense of
these alarmists.&nbsp; The day of rest can only be a period of
spiritual profit to those who value it for that purpose.&nbsp; To
impose its religious observances upon those who do not, is to
promote hypocrisy, not piety.&nbsp; For the religious world,
confessedly a minority, to seek to impose, by State interference,
their notions of what constitutes a day of rest upon the bulk of
their fellow-countrymen, is intolerant&mdash;an act of coercion
at variance with the first principles of Christianity.&nbsp;
There is good reason for believing that the cause of morality,
and therefore of religion, will, with the present tendencies of
the metropolitan working-classes, decidedly <i>gain</i> by the
opening of the Sydenham pleasure-grounds.&nbsp; It will be no
more harmful than free access to the Parks.&nbsp; It will not rob
the poor of their &ldquo;day of rest,&rdquo; because it is quite
optional with them <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>to go there; and, while they act as free agents, it may
be presumed, that they spend the day as best suits their
inclinations.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Crystal Palace Company are well able to take care of
themselves, nor does it form part of the plan of these pages to
defend their cause.&nbsp; But the wholesale abuse which is heaped
upon them is positively nauseating to the impartial observer,
considering how far they have gone in attempting to meet
religious scruples and prejudices. <a name="citation15"></a><a
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; The mingled
rant and cant issuing from these professedly religious newspapers
is extremely injurious to that Christianity in whose name they
profess to speak.&nbsp; Sad would it be for religion if its holy
claims were really associated with the untruthfulness these
organs have uttered&mdash;and the more reason why those, who are
jealous for the honour of their faith, should protest against its
name being mixed up with the effusions of intemperate
alarmists.&nbsp; From their spirit it might be thought that the
Company had set the religious world at defiance, instead of
shutting up for half the Sunday, closing the manufacturing and
commercial portions of the building, and forbidding the sale of
intoxicating drinks.&nbsp; If they <i>are</i> to blame, it is for
conceding too much to prejudice.&nbsp; Nothing is gained by
closing the grounds up to one o&rsquo;clock&mdash;not even the
good will of opponents.&nbsp; The principle which would allow
them to be thrown open for half, would be equally valid to keep
them open all, the day.&nbsp; At present, the arrangement is a
mischievous compromise between devotion and recreation, and
stamps the Sabbath on high authority with a continental
character.&nbsp; It gives a wrong notion of godliness, bringing
it into apparent antagonism to secular enjoyment&mdash;making one
portion of the day a counterpoise to the other&mdash;fostering
the delusion that religion is simply the observances of certain
duties and attendance in a place of worship.</p>
<p>If there be any truth in this plain statement of facts and
arguments, it follows that the agitation, being got up
professedly to prevent the Crown from sanctioning the opening of
the Crystal Palace on Sunday, is really directed against all
places of recreation accessible to the public on that day.&nbsp;
This, indeed, is the main drift of the declamatory appeals of its
promoters.&nbsp; They are either agitating on false pretences, or
covertly aiming at an object injurious to the liberties and
welfare of the country.&nbsp; If that object were openly avowed,
many timid friends of religious freedom who indulge certain vague
fears of <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>the increase of &ldquo;Sabbath desecration,&rdquo; would
shrink from supporting it.&nbsp; In either case, the leaders
prove their unfitness to be the guides of opinion.&nbsp; Want of
candour, fairness, and truthfulness, are doubly worthy of
exposure and condemnation when exhibited in connexion with the
name of Christianity.&nbsp; Religion suffers enough from open
foes, without the need for injuries from professed friends.&nbsp;
Hence, <i>because</i> they are jealous of its true character,
<i>because</i> anxious to vindicate its purity and
self-sustaining efficiency, it becomes the followers of Christ to
protest against this movement.&nbsp; The very fact that they
agree to a great extent in the religious views of the agitators
in question, and sincerely desire to see the Sabbath valued by
all men as an opportunity for spiritual culture and enjoyment, is
an additional reason why they should repudiate the sentiments
uttered, and the course pursued, under the banner of their
faith.&nbsp; The alarmists may rely upon it, that there are many
more followers of Christian truth than the writer of these pages,
who have no sympathy with that intolerance which would coerce
others into their convictions and their method of
&ldquo;keeping&rdquo; the Sabbath, and who observe, with pain and
indignation, the attempt of misguided, though perhaps
conscientious, men, to originate a crusade against the Sunday
recreations of the people.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is scarcely possible to discuss this particular topic
without the mind being directed to the general question&mdash;of
which it is only an offshoot&mdash;<i>the position assumed by
religious men in relation to the world at large</i>,
<i>especially to the masses</i>.&nbsp; A few considerations on
this momentous subject may appropriately and usefully be thrown
out in connexion with the foregoing arguments.</p>
<p>It may be at once stated, that there is no intention of
entering into any argument with the believers in the efficacy of
a State-appointed religion and priesthood.&nbsp; Those who
encourage this practical infidelity to the truths of
Christianity&mdash;whose principles would have obliged Christ to
exclaim, &ldquo;My kingdom <i>is</i> of this
world&rdquo;&mdash;are, doubtless, doing no violence to their
views in calling upon Government to insist upon &ldquo;the bitter
observance of the Sabbath,&rdquo; and to enforce upon Jews,
Infidels, and Mahomedans, outward conformity to the State
religion.</p>
<p>But it does so happen that many who are in bondage to this
intolerant principle, do, nevertheless, somehow or other,
acknowledge the transforming influence of Christian truth upon
the individual heart, and are at one, in their religious
convictions, with the open adherents of the voluntary
principle.&nbsp; To this united body of what are usually <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>designated
&ldquo;Evangelical Christians,&rdquo; the question may fairly be
put&mdash;whether they are pursuing that line of policy towards
the world which is best adapted to bring the world over to their
views?</p>
<p>Their object, next to their own spiritual
improvement&mdash;for that <i>seems</i> the great aim of modern
Christianity&mdash;is to commend the Gospel to those who have it
not&mdash;to win over to hearts of men to the authority of
Christ&mdash;to induce them to accept to the free offers of
reconciliation with God made through to Saviour, and evermore
live in His likeness.&nbsp; They will readily acknowledge that
religion is founded upon love, and adapted to call forth to
willing homage of grateful souls; and that the spontaneous,
cheerful surrender of self to God, the preference of His will to
ours, the cordial reliance upon Him for &ldquo;every good and
every perfect gift,&rdquo; is the very essence of
Christianity.&nbsp; Institutions, forms, and ceremonies, are but
the media for expressing this truth, and are worse than useless
without it.&nbsp; Sympathy between man and his Creator is
religion&mdash;to awaken that sympathy in others, will be the aim
of all who have felt it for themselves.</p>
<p>How, then, do Evangelical Christians commend this living truth
to those who do not profess allegiance to it?&nbsp; To a great
extent they conceal its benign character.&nbsp; They build a wall
around it, and make it appear to be an exclusive property.&nbsp;
Oftentimes they refuse to acknowledge it in others unless
associated with certain forms, symbols, and institutions.&nbsp;
They overlay it with the claims of this and that interest, or
make it speak in the language of this or the other ism.&nbsp;
They proclaim that the Gospel is omnipotent to save&mdash;that
Christ&rsquo;s kingdom is a spiritual kingdom, and His reign in
the heart of man&mdash;but, alas! practice and belief do not
correspond.&nbsp; They are, to a great extent, afraid to trust
Christianity to its inherent power.&nbsp; For the propagation of
the truth, or the extinction of unbelief, they will often have
recourse to means not in harmony with their convictions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The end sanctifies the means&rdquo;&mdash;often,
unconsciously, forms their rule of conduct, and quiets their
scruples in trying to make men religious by irreligious means, in
claiming the aid of the magistrate&rsquo;s sword in putting down
error, in demanding that the incitements to sin be removed by the
strong arm of compulsion, yea, sometimes, in attempting to
<i>coerce</i> the indifferent into the reception of to
truth.&nbsp; How greatly does this want of confidence in the
power of the Gospel contrast with that scriptural faith which is
able &ldquo;to remove mountains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A State religion is, no doubt, the greatest obstacle to a
proper appreciation of Christianity by the working
classes&mdash;for through that <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>medium it is reflected as simply an
elaborate machinery to provide comfortable incomes for an army of
priests&mdash;a gigantic establishment based upon
selfishness.&nbsp; But even this dead weight upon the progress of
religion would be greatly lightened if Evangelical Christians
rightly commended it to the affections of the people&mdash;if,
instead of bowing down to the great imposture, and drinking into
its spirit, they unceasingly displayed the benign and
disinterested character of the Gospel.&nbsp; Whatever the
religious organizations of the present day accomplish&mdash;and
it is not denied that they do something&mdash;they do not seem to
be capable of evangelizing the masses.&nbsp; To this objection it
is no reply to urge that they never have, except to a small
extent, effected that purpose.&nbsp; If true religion be what the
religious world say it is, there must be, irrespective of all
former experience, some lamentable deficiency in the mode of
presenting its great and omnipotent truths to the people.&nbsp;
For it is a notorious fact that the bulk of our working
population do not care for religion, scarcely come within range
of its teachings, and, for the most part, dislike its
professional representatives.&nbsp; Is there not here something
more than the natural aversion to superior goodness, and the
preference for self-gratification?</p>
<p>Every one will have fresh in recollection a touching episode
in that eminently religious book, &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s
Cabin,&rdquo; in which are detailed the successive steps in the
training of a little outcast negro.&nbsp; Miss Ophelia undertook
the benevolent task, and performed it only too
conscientiously.&nbsp; No pains, no sacrifices, were spared in
educating the benighted Topsy.&nbsp; The system of the Northern
lady was perfect in its mechanism.&nbsp; Instruction,
exhortation, reproof, punishment, followed in due order.&nbsp;
The young mind exhibited unusual quickness and aptitude in the
acquisition of knowledge.&nbsp; One element alone was
wanting&mdash;the moral influence of the teacher.&nbsp; That
being absent, all the rest seemed comparatively valueless.&nbsp;
Between the upright New Englander, with her unflinching sense of
duty and her prejudice against colour, and the hardened negro
girl, there was no connecting link&mdash;an entire absence of
affection and sympathy.&nbsp; Yet that moral waste on which the
lady of strong sense and set rules could make no impression, was
reclaimed by the kindness of a child.&nbsp; Topsy&rsquo;s heart,
steeled to Miss Ophelia&rsquo;s exhortations, melted at
Eva&rsquo;s sympathy. <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>This
story fitly illustrates the present relationship of the Church
and the world.&nbsp; Organised religious communities may
establish their societies, may erect their places of worship, may
give their lectures with the object of reclaiming the masses from
vice and irreligion, may proclaim the sinfulness and the duties
of men&mdash;and yet their labours may achieve only partial
success.&nbsp; The means may be admirable, but the spirit that
breathes through them may be defective.&nbsp; There may be a
great show of concern, the conscientious performance of a duty,
but an absence of that cordial, hearty interest which is
requisite to kindle sympathy.&nbsp; Surely there is a philosophy
in the use of religious agencies as in ordinary affairs.&nbsp; In
our efforts to evangelize the poor&mdash;to whom originally the
Gospel was preached, and amongst whom, it should never be
forgotten, were its greatest triumphs&mdash;we are bound to
consider the probable results of the <i>means</i> put in
operation, as well as the <i>end</i> sought, unless we expect God
to work a miracle.&nbsp; Otherwise, with all the elements of
success, we may make no progress; and, perchance, pull down with
one hand while we are building up with the other.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable, or at all in accordance with experience, to
suppose that the way to reach the hearts of the people is to put
ourselves into direct antagonism to their rights, habits, or
wishes?&nbsp; Do we commend the Gospel to them by fostering the
notion that men may be made religious by Act of Parliament, or
the fiat of the Crown&mdash;by insisting that they shall
&ldquo;keep&rdquo; the Sabbath according to our notions, not
their own&mdash;by clamouring to curtail the means of obtaining
pure air and recreation one day out of seven, because we consider
it &ldquo;sinful?&rdquo;&nbsp; The religious world is absorbed
with its &ldquo;causes&rdquo; and &ldquo;interests,&rdquo;
&ldquo;enjoyments&rdquo; and &ldquo;privileges;&rdquo; and, while
thus systematically turning its attention <i>inwards</i>, and
calculating every pulsation of the great world around in relation
to itself, is too apt to forget that there is a moral law whose
foundations lie deep in the principles of revealed
truth&mdash;and that any violation of the precepts of that law,
whether by abrogating natural rights, dictating the actions and
occupations of others, or coercing them into an apparent piety of
heart and life, is altogether foreign to the genius of
Christianity.&nbsp; Our Lord has given his followers an
injunction to preach the Gospel&mdash;the power of which over the
heart none who <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>have felt it can mistrust.&nbsp; If by this agency, and
this alone, the affections of man are to be changed and a new
life created within him&mdash;if, in a word, the world is to be
<i>won</i> over to the cause of truth, by the exhibition of
God&rsquo;s love&mdash;surely it indicates a want of worldly
wisdom as well as distrust of the Divine power and promises, for
the disciples of Christ to be calling to their aid extraneous
help;&mdash;at one time relying upon the sword of the civil
magistrates&mdash;at another on Parliamentary legislation.&nbsp;
If its professors are to be believed, Christianity is <i>ever</i>
in imminent danger.&nbsp; Between the encroachments of Popery and
the progress of Infidelity, we are always in a state of chronic
alarm for organized religion.&nbsp; Really it would seem, that if
it were not for the frequent exercise of a little
authority&mdash;that is, physical force, an occasional crusade
against Popery, a persecution <i>by society</i> of free inquiry,
the religious world would lose all confidence&mdash;Samson must
inevitably be overcome by the seductions of Delilah or the hosts
of the Philistines.&nbsp; It may safely be concluded that, where
this faithlessness obtains, the power of the Gospel is
deficient.&nbsp; Christianity is essentially aggressive, but,
according to the experience of its degenerate disciples, it is
hard work to act upon the defensive.&nbsp; Does not the outside
world take note of these things?&nbsp; What more natural than
that the sceptic and indifferent should doubt the alleged power
of religion when such are its apparent manifestations&mdash;when,
positively, any particular discovery of great advantage to
mankind, such as the application of steam to locomotion, or any
special event promising social benefit, such as the opening of
the new Crystal Palace, fills its adherents with apprehension,
because it seems to disturb their particular interests?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>How is the great gulph that separates the masses of the people
from religious institutions to be bridged over?&nbsp; Here is a
problem worthy of the anxious consideration of the religious
world.&nbsp; To treat so great a subject would require the
compass of a volume instead of a pamphlet.&nbsp; Indeed, it has
already been discussed <i>in extenso</i> by others; so that it is
superfluous to do more in these pages, than refer to one or two
points directly bearing on the question in hand.&nbsp; It may
then be remarked, that to secure the required end it is needful
not only <i>to do</i>, but that much <i>must be left
undone</i>&mdash;especially in the direction of the poor
man&rsquo;s pleasures.&nbsp; If the Gospel be not taken to them
they were better left alone; for interference with their rights
only irritates them, and widens the gulph.&nbsp; The two forces
will, as things go, move <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>on like parallel lines, but never
unite.&nbsp; The bulk of the people are far beyond the reach of
such delusive palliatives as stopping Sunday trains, and shutting
up tea-gardens and public-houses.&nbsp; The preacher&rsquo;s
voice rarely reaches them, and Christianity itself wears, in
their eyes, the stigma of being a middle-class religion, not
adapted to the poor, to whom originally it was &ldquo;glad
tidings of salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are, besides, almost
ostracised from our religious assemblies.&nbsp; Talk of Sabbath
desecration!&nbsp; Suppose working-men&mdash;say, for example,
the 10,000 pleasure-seekers on the Croydon line&mdash;were to
flock to our places of worship?&nbsp; What is to be done with
them?&nbsp; There is at present no room for them <i>in the
system</i>.&nbsp; It requires time and money to erect and
consecrate steepled buildings, fashion pews, make cushions,
choose a professional minister, and organize collections,
&amp;c.&nbsp; And <i>when</i> done, how does it suit the tastes
and sympathies of the poor?&nbsp; Do they not feel themselves out
of place, and suspect the means are made of importance
disproportionate to, and even obstructive of, the end?&nbsp;
Christianity appears to them entrenched behind a barricade of
forms and creeds, and genteel requirements, which its followers
have erected.&nbsp; The world without catches but a distant and
imperfect glimpse of its benign features.&nbsp; Religious men
prefer standing behind their entrenchments to an aggressive
movement in front, or if they do advance it is with incumbrances
great as those which impede an English army marching over the
plains of India.&nbsp; Costly temples, with elegant spires, are
becoming increasingly necessary to the proclamation of Divine
truth, and, in not a few cases, pious men half sink under the
sacrifices thus incurred, or the load of debt contracted.&nbsp;
There is something quite affecting in the fact, that while the
masses of the people are getting farther and farther off from the
agency of religious institutions, Christians who are ever
denouncing the external pomp and show of Popery are, as it were,
<i>concentrating</i> their attention on genteel and elegant
places of worship, and in all their arrangements for the
celebration of religion approximating to the Romanist
standard.&nbsp; And this&mdash;when a portion of such superfluous
expenditure would provide means for carrying the Gospel into the
ranks of the poor&mdash;is boasted of as a mark of taste&mdash;of
Christian earnestness&mdash;of religious progress!&nbsp; Fatal
delusion! <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a></p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Men&rsquo;s susceptibilities are the same as ever they
were&mdash;but how to awaken them?&nbsp; The religious world will
find it in the career and directions of their great Exemplar,
<i>not</i> in the bearing of the Pharisees.&nbsp; The grand truth
embodied in the aphorism of our great dramatist&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;One
touch of Nature<br />
Makes the whole world kin,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>has a spiritual as well as a social meaning.&nbsp; To recur to
our former illustration.&nbsp; A child with love in her heart and
sympathy in her eye, may subdue the will when reason and
authority utterly fail.&nbsp; By approaching the masses in this
spirit, the religious world may gain access to their affections,
and will, no doubt, find that the Gospel retains its pristine
omnipotence.&nbsp; But if they are to be treated as the patrimony
of organized religious societies and institutions, to be
&ldquo;cribbed, cabined, and confined&rdquo; at their pleasure,
and admonished from afar off on the sinfulness of Sunday
recreation&mdash;if the enormities of Popery are more zealously
denounced, and hair-splitting differences agitated, by ministers
and their flocks, than <span class="GutSmall">THE TRUTH</span>
preached &ldquo;<i>in the love of it</i>&rdquo;&mdash;farewell to
all hopes of making any substantial progress in evangelizing the
great bulk of the working classes! <a name="citation22"></a><a
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>By such
movements as that we have objected to, the poor are being driven
<i>farther off</i> from Christianity.&nbsp; Suppose this
particular Sabbatarian agitation to be successful, where is the
gain to religion?&nbsp; Will it not be associated in the minds of
those already out of reach of the preaching of the Gospel, with a
dog-in-the-manger meddlesomeness, with the claims of rival
systems, and the designs of interested priests?&nbsp; What an
encouragement would it be to that party represented by the
&ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Day Society,&rdquo; who would avowedly use
their triumph as a stepping-stone to further demands&mdash;who
would stop all trains and conveyances on the Sabbath, except,
perhaps, the carriage of the rich&mdash;who would ruthlessly
sacrifice the health of the working-man by confining him to the
filth and closeness of this wilderness of bricks and mortar, and
who would erect over the remains of pure and gentle Christianity,
a gigantic system of hypocrisy and formalism which would ill
conceal the hatred and disgust of all classes for a religion
without heart or sincerity!</p>
<p>To treat the working-classes in the spirit of those who are
fomenting this agitation, is unjust and cruel, as well as
impolitic.&nbsp; The point has been before adverted to, but will
bear amplification.&nbsp; Suppose the Rev. Mr. Orthodox, the
popular preacher of the West End, discussing this question of
&ldquo;Sabbath desecration&rdquo; in the squalid apartment (if
ever he has found his way there) of John Starveling, the
overworked slop-tailor, of Typhus Court, Westminster.&nbsp; To
the weighty arguments of the wealthy rector, on the necessity of
shutting up all railways and stopping all conveyances, may not
the poor underpaid artizan reply, that the Sabbath was made for
man, not man for the Sabbath&mdash;that God requires mercy, not
sacrifice&mdash;that the Sunday trip is to him the safety valve
of life&mdash;that so long as he is obliged to work for six days
out of seven, without intermission, to keep body and soul
together, <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>the seventh <i>must</i> be devoted to renovation.&nbsp;
Let the charge of mammon-worship rest on the right
shoulders.&nbsp; If the Crystal Palace Company, who enable this
poor man to inhale the pure air and enjoy the beauties of nature,
are actuated by sordid motives, how much more are they&mdash;and
their name is legion&mdash;who allow their passion for
money-getting to reduce thousands to a life of slavery, and
oblige them to regard Sunday not as the Lord&rsquo;s Day, but
only an opportunity to repair their wasted health and
energies.</p>
<p>There is not much doubt or danger in the conclusion that
whatever tends to ameliorate the condition of the people, to
ennoble their tastes, to expand their ideas, or to improve their
physical well-being, opens a more favourable field for the
influence of religion.&nbsp; The converse of this truth will be
seen in the almost hopelessly-irreclaimable state of the adult
&ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; classes.&nbsp; Religious bodies mistake
in shaping their plans as if there were no medium, looked at from
a Christian point of view, between the lowest depths of depraved
self-indulgence, and the pure aspirations of devotion.&nbsp; They
are not exempt from recognising the truth, that all physical,
social, and political improvements, as well as the consistency,
meekness, and gentleness of the followers of the Gospel, have a
bearing upon the spiritual destinies of mankind.&nbsp; When will
they cordially acknowledge in their creed that the man who
discountenances the mammon-grasping spirit of the age&mdash;who
promotes the education of the poor&mdash;who advocates a reform
of prison discipline&mdash;who helps to sweeten an unwholesome
neighbourhood&mdash;who encourages pure and healthy recreation,
is doing more to prepare a soil favourable for the reception of
religious truth, and to break down the barriers which interpose
between the working classes and the religious world than the
No-Popery agitator, the loud-mouthed denouncer of &ldquo;Sabbath
desecration,&rdquo; or the zealous stickler for outward
uniformity and formal observances?&nbsp; The one is doing
something to repair dilapidated humanity&mdash;the other is
interposing fresh obstacles to that great desideratum.</p>

wrapped up in it had been invested with the folds of modern
religionism, would, doubtless, have described it as
fanaticism.&nbsp; So much depends upon the shape and spirit in
which religion is presented.&nbsp; May not some portion of the
aversion set down to the <i>thing</i> sometimes result from the
<i>mode</i> of its presentation?</p>
<p><a name="footnote21"></a><a href="#citation21"
class="footnote">[21]</a>&nbsp; This statement may be set down as
an exaggeration of the facts.&nbsp; It was, however suggested to
the mind of the writer, by the perusal of a striking speech of
the Rev. Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s, at a recent meeting in Manchester,
in aid of a Jubilee Fund for the Sunday School Union.&nbsp; In
the course of his address, he adverted to &ldquo;the terrible
fact&rdquo; that if the clergy of all denominations, and the city
missionaries, with all their converts and adherents, were removed
from the great metropolis, &ldquo;the blank thereby created would
not be very great.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went on to say that
&ldquo;adult conversions&rdquo; in London and England were
&ldquo;a rare thing,&rdquo; and to describe the class as
&ldquo;sealed, unapproachable, unimpressible.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
proceeded in the following strain:&mdash;&ldquo;Were you to
multiply your ministers, both Church and Dissent, with real
evangelical men, and to build edifices so that each thousand of
our adult population should command for its service&mdash;if it
choose to avail itself of it&mdash;such clergymen, or minister,
it would very slightly alter the case . . .&nbsp; I have no
hesitation in saying, that, unless some other agency than the
public ministration of the Word is brought actively into
operation, even if we had such an assemblage of gifts and talents
concentred in our preachers as the world never saw, we could not
do much.&rdquo;&nbsp; His hope lay only in the influence of
Sunday Schools upon the minds of the young.</p>
<p><a name="footnote22"></a><a href="#citation22"
class="footnote">[22]</a>&nbsp; The writer does not deem the
tenour of the above arguments inconsistent with a belief in the
fact that the major part of whatever good is <i>done</i> in this
world for elevating fallen humanity, socially or religiously,
results from the self-denying efforts of pious men.&nbsp; While
others <i>talk</i> they <i>act</i>.&nbsp; They deserve all honour
for what they accomplish, but have no claim, on that account, to
be exempted from fair comment.&nbsp; These strictures will, no
doubt, be set down to a censorious spirit, and not unlikely the
writer will be denounced as an enemy in disguise.&nbsp; This,
however, is the lot of all reformers and objectors to things as
they are.&nbsp; <i>For its own sake</i>, irrespectively of the
general principle, the Christian Church ought to value the right
of free discussion.&nbsp; Honest criticism of a good cause, is
much more to be desired than undiscriminating praise.&nbsp; It is
a mournful fact, and <i>in itself</i> a sure symptom of
unhealthiness, that there is scarcely a religious magazine or
newspaper which dare venture to give utterance to such sentiments
as are contained in this pamphlet.&nbsp; The outcry raised
against the candid expression of opinion has these, amongst
others, injurious effects&mdash;it perpetuates corruption, it
drives intelligent young men away from religious societies, and
it furnishes unbelievers with a cogent argument against the
Gospel.&nbsp; God grant that the Christian Church may put away
this mischievous intolerance, and pursue their mission with a
greater breadth of plan, wisdom of purpose, toleration of
differences, and economy of means.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
